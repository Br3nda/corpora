# corpora
corpora is a Django project for gathering corpora for different languages. It's been built to support any number of languages with Te Reo Māori as its first.

The goal of this app is to streamline corpora gathering for minority languages so that dictation, personal assistants, and 
other technologies can work in te reo Māori, ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi, and other indigenous languages.

## Supported Languages
- Māori

You can help us add more languages by translating this app. The current project is live at https://koreromaori.com/. If you'd like to lead a copora gathering campaign for your language, get in touch as we'd love to help.

# Kōrero Māori
Kōrero Māori is the project that's funding the build of corpora. Kōrero Māori is an initiative started by Te Hiku Media and supported by a number of organizations. The goal is to train machines to transcribe thousands of hours or native language speaker audio recordings to make native te reo Māori more accessible to language learners as our native speaker population is in decline.

We are always looking for more support either financially or through in kind contributions. If you're keen to get involved please get in touch by emailing us at koreromaori@tehiku.nz.
